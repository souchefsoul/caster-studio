# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-19)

**Current focus:** v1.1 — Mobile-Usable Site

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.0 Roadmap]: 3-phase coarse roadmap — Foundation, Workspace+OnModel, Full Gen Suite+Org
- [v1.0 Roadmap]: On-Model generation bundled with workspace (Phase 2) to deliver first end-to-end flow early
- [v1.0 Revision]: Billing (BILL-01 through BILL-04) removed from v1 scope entirely
- [01-01]: Tailwind CSS v4 with @tailwindcss/vite plugin
- [01-01]: shadcn/ui v4 base-nova style
- [Phase 02-01]: Windows 95 flat design: rounded-none, visible 1px borders, no shadows/gradients/animations
- [Phase 02-01]: Sidebar uses fixed positioning with z-40 overlay on mobile, static on lg+ breakpoint
- [Phase 02-02]: FAL proxy pattern: fetch to ${SUPABASE_URL}/functions/v1/fal-proxy
- [Phase 03-01]: Fire-and-forget persistence: saveGeneration errors logged, do not block UI
- [Phase 03-01]: Generation history limited to 200 most recent per user
- [Phase 03-02]: BrandFacePanel placed above mode-specific panels in sidebar as global component
- [Phase 03-04]: Catalog/colorway parallel generation via Promise.allSettled
- [Phase 03-06]: Adopted @fal-ai/client; fal-proxy reduced to dumb x-fal-target-url pass-through
- [Phase 03-06]: Reference images uploaded directly to fal.storage, not Supabase Storage — eliminates WORKER_RESOURCE_LIMIT
- [Phase 03-06]: Queue polling moved to browser via fal.subscribe(); edge function no longer blocks on Kling jobs
- [Phase 03-06]: numImages fan-out: N parallel calls with num_images=1 for reliable count and isolated failures
- [Phase 03-06]: useAuth preserves user reference across silent token refreshes; useGenerations merges fetched + in-memory
- [Phase 03-06]: On-Model redesigned — single multi-image grid (up to 10) + Front/Back view toggle, no per-angle UI
- [Phase 03-06]: Collections feature removed from UI and DB (migration 002 drops tables)
- [Phase 03-06]: fal-proxy deployed with --no-verify-jwt to work around ES256 JWT signing keys
- [Phase 03-06]: Migration 002 adds 'video' to generations.mode CHECK, adds DELETE RLS policy, creates uploads bucket
- [v1.1 Scope]: Responsive web (not PWA/native) — same React app, Tailwind breakpoints
- [v1.1 Scope]: Feature parity on mobile — no feature cuts vs desktop
- [v1.1 Scope]: Keep Windows 95 flat aesthetic on mobile (no redesign)
